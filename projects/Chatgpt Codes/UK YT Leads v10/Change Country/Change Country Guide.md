# Change Country Guide (UK YT Leads)

This package targets: **United Kingdom only (YouTube code GB).**

You change the target in ONE file: `config/settings.json`.

## Step by step
1. Open `config/settings.json` (on GitHub: repo, `config`, `settings.json`, pencil icon).
2. Change the first lines:
   ```
   "countries": ["GB"],
   "banned_countries": ["IN", "PK", "BD"],
   "unknown_country_policy": "accept",
   "search_language": "en",
   "spreadsheet_title": "UK YT Leads",
   ```
   - `countries`: 2-letter codes, one or several (table below). United Kingdom is **GB**.
   - `spreadsheet_title`: the name the Google Sheet is given on the next run.
3. Raise `rule_version` by 1 (so every known channel is judged again under the new country).
4. Use a NEW Google Sheet for a new country:
   1. Create a blank Google Sheet.
   2. Share it as Editor with the service account email (the `...iam.gserviceaccount.com` address in your key file).
   3. Copy its ID (the long text between `/d/` and `/edit`).
   4. GitHub repo, Settings, Secrets and variables, Actions: edit `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`.
5. Commit, then Actions, Run workflow.

## Country codes
| Country | Code | Country | Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| United States | US | Germany | DE |
| Canada | CA | Russia | RU |
| United Kingdom | **GB** (not UK) | Singapore | SG |
| Australia | AU | Malta | MT |
| New Zealand | NZ | South Africa | ZA |
| Ireland | IE | United Arab Emirates | AE |

The automation accepts "UK" and turns it into GB, but write GB.

## Banned countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh)
`"banned_countries": ["IN", "PK", "BD"]` are rejected completely: they are NOT added to All Leads and NOT added to Needs Review.
How it decides, in this order:
1. Channel country field set: banned or not a target country means rejected. A target country means accepted, whatever the creator's name is.
2. Country field blank: reject if the channel text points to a banned place (city names, `.in` `.pk` `.bd` addresses), if videos are in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu and similar, or the video language region is IN/PK/BD.
3. Still blank and the text shows a target country (for example London): accepted.
4. Still blank and the channel name looks South Asian: rejected.
5. Nothing found: follows `unknown_country_policy`.
To ban more, add codes to `banned_countries` (and add place words under `country_hints` if the code has no built in hints).

## unknown_country_policy (channels with no country on the channel page)
- `"accept"` (default): qualified, with a note "Country not set on channel". Nothing qualified waits in Needs Review.
- `"review"`: goes to Needs Review with the reason written.
- `"reject"`: dropped.

## Several countries
`["AU", "NZ", "IE"]` searches and accepts all of them. The 99 daily searches are shared, so each country gets a smaller share.

## Several languages
Do not mix languages in one package. English packages use `"search_language": "en"`. For another language, make a new package: set `search_language` (for example `"de"`), use that country, and replace `config/niches.json` with search phrases in that language (see the Russian package for an example).

## Niches
`config/niches.json`: each niche has `name` (also the tab name), `queries` (search phrases) and `signals` (words that identify the niche). A channel with no niche is still qualified and appears in All Leads.

## Your decisions stick
- A channel already in All Leads is never added to Needs Review.
- A channel sitting in Needs Review is never added to All Leads by the automation. Move the row by hand (cut and paste) when you approve it.
- A channel in All Leads only receives NEW contact rows (new emails) at the bottom.
- Type `reject` in the Review Decision column of Needs Review to stop the automation checking a channel again.

## Header order
All packages share the master header (see `Master Header.md`). Data is written by column NAME, so inserting or moving columns never overwrites data. For an old sheet whose columns are in another order set `"align_headers": true` for ONE run: the tab is re-ordered by name, extra columns of yours are kept after the master columns, and the ID formulas are rebuilt. Make a copy of the sheet first (File, Make a copy). Set it back to `false` after the run.
